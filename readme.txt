== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get another website supported? =

Just post a comment to [my blog](http://abisso.org/index.php/projects/about-me/) or [open a ticket](http://code.l0g.in/about-me/issues/new/) with a link to any user page on that site.

I will add suggested sites in upcoming releases.

= When I hit 'Add' nothing happens =
The 'add' button is linked to an ajax function provided by prototype lib. Some other plugins inject their own version of prototype, instead of using the one provided by WP, this result in a broken 'add' button.

If you are using **Use Google Libraries** plugins read [this](http://code.l0g.in/about-me/issue/7/wp-28-final-add-button-is-disabled)

= I've updated from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 and my widget disappered =

From version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 About Me widget has been renamed to 'About Me - Social Link', so you have simply to add it from the widgets page.
