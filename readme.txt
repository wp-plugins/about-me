== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get another website supported? =

Just post a comment to [my blog](http://abisso.org/index.php/projects/about-me/) or [open a ticket](http://bb.alessiocaiazza.info/about-me/issues/new/) with a link to any user page on that site.

I will add suggested sites in upcoming releases.

= I've updated from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 and my widget disappered =

From version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 About Me widget has been renamed to 'About Me - Social Link', so you have simply to add it from the widgets page.
